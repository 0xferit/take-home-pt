## 🎯 Success Criteria

### ✅ Deployment Successful If:

**Critical Test Passes:**
```javascript
// €250k medium risk MUST return 820-860
TakeHomeLogic.calculateInsurancePremium({
  revenue: 250000,
  riskTierOverride: 'medium',
  usaCoverage: false,
  claimsHistory: 'clean',
  yearsInBusiness: 3,
}).annualPremium
// Expected: ~838
```

**All 5 Tests Pass:**
- ✅ Test 1: €250k medium risk → €820-860
- ✅ Test 2: €50k medium risk → €440-480
- ✅ Test 3: €400k medium risk → €1,200-1,350
- ✅ Test 4: €100k low risk → €370-430
- ✅ Test 5: €200k high risk + USA → €2,300-2,700

**Parameters Verified:**
- ✅ All 6 base/variable rates updated
- ✅ Portugal discount = 0.88
- ✅ Economies of scale thresholds set

## 🛠️ Files to Modify

**Only 1 file needs changes:**
- ✅ `logic.js` (3 sections, ~30 lines of code)

**No changes needed to:**
- ❌ `index.html`
- ❌ `app.js`
- ❌ `styles.css`
- ❌ Any other files

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before You Start:
1. **Backup `logic.js`** - just in case
2. **Read the full implementation doc** - don't skip steps
3. **Clear browser cache** before testing
4. **Have dev console open** - for validation

### During Implementation:
5. **Copy parameters exactly** - typos will break tests
6. **Insert new code in correct location** - check line numbers
7. **Don't modify other parts of the file** - only insurance section

### After Deployment:
8. **Run all 5 tests** - critical validation
9. **Test in UI manually** - enter €250k and verify ~€838
10. **Monitor for errors** - check console for issues
