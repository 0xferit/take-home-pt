## ERROR #1: Social Security - No Cap Applied

### Accountant's Calculation
```
Formula: ‚Ç¨150,000 √ó 70% √ó 21.4% √ó 75%
Result: ‚Ç¨16,852.50
```

**Problems:**
1. ‚ùå Applied 75% coefficient to SS base (coefficients only apply to IRS, not SS)
2. ‚ùå Did NOT apply 12 √ó IAS monthly cap (‚Ç¨6,270/month)

### Correct Calculation (Lei n.¬∫ 110/2009, Art. 168¬∫)
```
1. Quarterly gross:        ‚Ç¨150,000 / 4 = ‚Ç¨37,500
2. Relevant income (70%):  ‚Ç¨37,500 √ó 70% = ‚Ç¨26,250
3. Monthly:                ‚Ç¨26,250 / 3 = ‚Ç¨8,750
4. Apply cap:              min(‚Ç¨8,750, ‚Ç¨6,270) = ‚Ç¨6,270 ‚úÖ
5. Monthly SS:             ‚Ç¨6,270 √ó 21.4% = ‚Ç¨1,341.78
6. Annual:                 ‚Ç¨1,341.78 √ó 12 = ‚Ç¨16,101.36 ‚úÖ
```

**Legal Basis:**
- **Source:** Lei n.¬∫ 110/2009, Article 168¬∫
- **IAS 2025:** ‚Ç¨522.50 (Portaria n.¬∫ 6-B/2025)
- **Maximum base:** 12 √ó IAS = 12 √ó ‚Ç¨522.50 = ‚Ç¨6,270/month
- **Rate:** 21.4%

**Impact:** Accountant overcharged SS by **‚Ç¨751.14/year**

---

## ERROR #2: IRS Tax - Solidarity Tax Missing

### Accountant's Calculation
```
Taxable income: ‚Ç¨112,500 (‚Ç¨150,000 √ó 75% coefficient)
IRS @ 20% NHR:  ‚Ç¨112,500 √ó 20% = ‚Ç¨22,500.00
Solidarity tax: NOT CALCULATED ‚ùå
```

### Correct Calculation (Lei n.¬∫ 82-B/2014, Art. 191)
```
Taxable income:   ‚Ç¨112,500
Base IRS @ 20%:   ‚Ç¨112,500 √ó 20% = ‚Ç¨22,500.00
Solidarity tax:   (‚Ç¨112,500 - ‚Ç¨80,000) √ó 2.5% = ‚Ç¨812.50 ‚úÖ
Total IRS:        ‚Ç¨22,500.00 + ‚Ç¨812.50 = ‚Ç¨23,312.50 ‚úÖ
```

**Legal Basis:**
- **Source:** Lei n.¬∫ 82-B/2014, Article 191
- **Tier 1:** ‚Ç¨80,000 - ‚Ç¨250,000 @ 2.5%
- **Tier 2:** >‚Ç¨250,000 @ 5.0%
- **Applies to:** Taxable income above ‚Ç¨80,000

**Impact:** Accountant undercharged IRS by **‚Ç¨812.50/year**

## NET EFFECT ANALYSIS

**Accountant's Errors:**

| Error | Amount | Effect on User |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| SS overcalculated | +‚Ç¨751.14 | User pays MORE (bad) |
| IRS undercalculated | -‚Ç¨812.50 | User pays LESS (also bad - illegal!) |
| Accounting estimate high | +‚Ç¨400.00 | Conservative estimate |
| **Net Effect** | **-‚Ç¨461.36** | **User actually owes more** |

**But with correct accounting estimate:**

| Calculation | Net Income | Difference |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Accountant (with errors) | ‚Ç¨84,447.50 | Baseline |
| Our calculator (correct) | ‚Ç¨84,786.14 | **+‚Ç¨338.64** ‚úÖ |

**Result:** When using correct calculations AND realistic accounting estimate (‚Ç¨800 vs ‚Ç¨1,200), user nets **‚Ç¨338.64 more** per year.

## WHY THESE ERRORS MATTER

### 1. Social Security Overcalculation

**Impact:**
- Accountant: Pay ‚Ç¨16,852.50/year
- Reality: Pay ‚Ç¨16,101.36/year
- **Overpayment: ‚Ç¨751.14/year**

**Why it's wrong:**
- Portuguese law (Lei 110/2009) mandates a MAXIMUM SS base of 12 √ó IAS
- For 2025: 12 √ó ‚Ç¨522.50 = ‚Ç¨6,270/month
- Accountant's formula ignores this cap
- This is a LEGAL requirement, not optional

**User Action:**
- If paying based on accountant's number: OVERPAYING
- Correct calculation saves ‚Ç¨751.14/year

### 2. IRS Tax Undercalculation

**Impact:**
- Accountant: Pay ‚Ç¨22,500/year
- Reality: Pay ‚Ç¨23,312.50/year
- **Underpayment: ‚Ç¨812.50/year**

**Why it's wrong:**
- Solidarity tax (Lei 82-B/2014) applies to taxable income >‚Ç¨80,000
- Taxable income of ‚Ç¨112,500 triggers 2.5% solidarity on ‚Ç¨32,500
- Accountant forgot this additional tax layer
- This is MANDATORY, not optional

**User Action:**
- If paying based on accountant's number: UNDERPAYING
- Tax authority will demand ‚Ç¨812.50 + penalties + interest
- Must correct this immediately

## APPENDIX: Formula Comparison

### Social Security

**Accountant (WRONG):**
```
‚Ç¨150,000 √ó 70% √ó 21.4% √ó 75% = ‚Ç¨16,852.50 ‚ùå
Problems:
- Incorrectly applies 75% coefficient
- No monthly cap applied
```

**Calculator (CORRECT):**
```
Quarterly: ‚Ç¨150,000 / 4 = ‚Ç¨37,500
Relevant:  ‚Ç¨37,500 √ó 70% = ‚Ç¨26,250
Monthly:   ‚Ç¨26,250 / 3 = ‚Ç¨8,750
Capped:    min(‚Ç¨8,750, ‚Ç¨6,270) = ‚Ç¨6,270 ‚úÖ
Monthly:   ‚Ç¨6,270 √ó 21.4% = ‚Ç¨1,341.78
Annual:    ‚Ç¨1,341.78 √ó 12 = ‚Ç¨16,101.36 ‚úÖ
```

### IRS Tax

**Accountant (WRONG):**
```
Taxable: ‚Ç¨150,000 √ó 75% = ‚Ç¨112,500
IRS:     ‚Ç¨112,500 √ó 20% = ‚Ç¨22,500.00 ‚ùå
(Missing solidarity tax)
```

**Calculator (CORRECT):**
```
Taxable:    ‚Ç¨150,000 √ó 75% = ‚Ç¨112,500
Base IRS:   ‚Ç¨112,500 √ó 20% = ‚Ç¨22,500.00
Solidarity: (‚Ç¨112,500 - ‚Ç¨80,000) √ó 2.5% = ‚Ç¨812.50 ‚úÖ
Total:      ‚Ç¨22,500.00 + ‚Ç¨812.50 = ‚Ç¨23,312.50 ‚úÖ
```
