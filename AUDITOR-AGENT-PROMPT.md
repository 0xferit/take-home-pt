## üéØ YOUR MISSION

You are an expert auditor specializing in Portuguese tax law and financial calculator compliance. Your task is to perform a **comprehensive audit** of the TakeHome PT calculator at https://take-home-pt.netlify.app/ using the **V2.0 Audit Routine**.

**Critical Context:**  
Previous audits (V1.0) scored 93-95/100 but **MISSED 8 wrong tax bracket rates** (0.4-0.5% off). This is unacceptable for a financial calculator. V2.0 fixes this by requiring **data accuracy verification FIRST** before any functional testing.

---

## üìã PREREQUISITES

Before you begin, you MUST:

1. **Read the V2.0 Audit Routine:**  
   - File: `AUDIT-ROUTINE.md` in the repository
   - This is your complete instruction manual
   - Do NOT skip any phases

2. **Understand the Philosophy:**  
   - **Data accuracy FIRST, functionality SECOND**
   - Primary sources ONLY (no blogs, no generic sites)
   - Zero tolerance for regulatory errors
   - "Verify, don't trust"

3. **Record the Version:**  
   - Go to https://take-home-pt.netlify.app/
   - Find the version number in the footer (format: vYYYY.MM.DD)
   - **Include this version in your audit report header**

---

## üîí CRITICAL RULE: MANDATORY PHASE ORDER

**YOU MUST EXECUTE PHASES IN THIS EXACT ORDER:**

1. ‚úÖ **Phase 1:** Primary Source Gathering (MANDATORY FIRST)
2. ‚úÖ **Phase 2:** Data Accuracy Verification (40% weight - BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE)
3. ‚úÖ **Phase 3:** Government Source Link Verification (15% weight)
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Phase 4+:** Only proceed if Phase 2 has ZERO errors

**If Phase 2 fails ‚Üí STOP immediately. Report CRITICAL FAILURE. Do NOT continue to other phases.**

---

## üìñ PHASE-BY-PHASE INSTRUCTIONS

### Phase 1: Pre-Audit Preparation (MANDATORY)

**Objective:** Gather all 8 primary source documents from Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica.

**Tasks:**
1. Download/access these documents:
   - Lei n.¬∫ 55-A/2025 (IRS tax brackets)
   - Portaria n.¬∫ 6-B/2025 (IAS value)
   - Decreto-Lei n.¬∫ 112/2024 (RMMG value)
   - Lei n.¬∫ 110/2009 (Social Security rates)
   - Decreto-Lei n.¬∫ 9/2025 (CAE Rev. 4)
   - Portaria n.¬∫ 1011/2001 (Article 151 professions)
   - Lei n.¬∫ 24-D/2024 (IRS Jovem schedule)
   - Lei n.¬∫ 82-B/2014 (Solidarity tax)

2. Create a verification spreadsheet with columns:
   - Constant/Rate Name
   - Official Value (from primary source)
   - Calculator Value (to be tested in Phase 2)
   - Match? (Yes/No)
   - Source Article/Law
   - Date Verified

**Checkpoint:** Do you have ALL 8 primary sources? If NO, you cannot proceed to Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: Data Accuracy Verification (CRITICAL - 40% WEIGHT)

**Objective:** Verify EVERY constant in the calculator matches official government sources EXACTLY.

**Test 2.1: IRS Tax Brackets (ZERO TOLERANCE)**

Access the calculator's source code:
- File: `data.js` or production at `https://take-home-pt.netlify.app/data.js`
- Locate: `TAX_BRACKETS_2025` array

Compare these 9 rates against Lei n.¬∫ 55-A/2025, Article 68.¬∫:

| Bracket | Income (‚Ç¨) | Official Rate | Calculator Rate | Match? |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | 0-8,059 | 12.5% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 2 | 8,059-12,160 | 16.0% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 3 | 12,160-17,233 | 21.5% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 4 | 17,233-22,306 | 24.4% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 5 | 22,306-28,400 | 31.4% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 6 | 28,400-41,629 | 34.9% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 7 | 41,629-44,987 | 43.1% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 8 | 44,987-83,696 | 44.6% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 9 | >83,696 | 48.0% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Even 0.1% difference = FAIL. If ANY rate is wrong ‚Üí STOP. Report CRITICAL FAILURE.

---

**Test 2.2: Core Constants**

Verify these 10 constants:

| Constant | Official Value | Calculator | Match? | Source |
|----------|---------------|------------|--------|--------|
| IAS_2025 | ‚Ç¨522.50 | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] | Portaria 6-B/2025 Art. 2¬∫ |
| RMMG_2025 | ‚Ç¨870.00 | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] | DL 112/2024 Art. 3¬∫ |
| SS_Rate_SelfEmployed | 21.4% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] | Lei 110/2009 Art. 168¬∫ |
| SS_Rate_Employer | 23.75% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] | Lei 110/2009 Art. 53¬∫ |
| SS_Rate_Employee | 11% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] | Lei 110/2009 Art. 53¬∫ |
| Solidarity_Tier1_Min | ‚Ç¨80,000 | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] | Lei 82-B/2014 Art. 191 |
| Solidarity_Tier1_Max | ‚Ç¨250,000 | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] | Lei 82-B/2014 Art. 191 |
| Solidarity_Tier1_Rate | 2.5% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] | Lei 82-B/2014 Art. 191 |
| Solidarity_Tier2_Min | ‚Ç¨250,000 | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] | Lei 82-B/2014 Art. 191 |
| Solidarity_Tier2_Rate | 5% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] | Lei 82-B/2014 Art. 191 |

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Any mismatch = CRITICAL FAILURE.

---

**Test 2.3: IRS Jovem Schedule**

Verify the 10-year progressive exemption schedule:

| Year | Official % | Calculator | Match? |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | 100% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 2 | 75% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 3 | 75% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 4 | 75% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 5 | 50% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 6 | 50% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 7 | 50% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 8 | 25% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 9 | 25% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
| 10 | 25% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |

Also verify: Income cap = 55 √ó IAS = 55 √ó ‚Ç¨522.50 = **‚Ç¨28,737.50**

Source: Lei n.¬∫ 24-D/2024, CIRS Article 2-B

---

**Test 2.4: CAE Classification Version**

Check the calculator for CAE references:

**Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Must reference "CAE Rev. 4" (not Rev. 3)
- ‚úÖ Must cite Decreto-Lei n.¬∫ 9/2025
- ‚úÖ Effective date: January 1, 2025

**How to check:**
1. Search calculator page for "CAE Rev"
2. Check methodology section for classification system references
3. Verify no outdated "Rev. 3" references

**FAIL if:** Any reference to "CAE Rev. 3" as current version

**Phase 2 Checkpoint:**

Calculate Phase 2 score:
- Tax Brackets: [X]/9 correct ‚Üí [Score]/10
- Core Constants: [X]/10 correct ‚Üí [Score]/10
- IRS Jovem: [X]/11 correct ‚Üí [Score]/10
- CAE Version: [PASS/FAIL] ‚Üí [Score]/10

**Total Phase 2: [Score]/40**

**CRITICAL FAILURE CHECK:**
- [ ] Any tax bracket wrong? ‚Üí AUTO-FAIL entire audit
- [ ] Any core constant wrong? ‚Üí AUTO-FAIL entire audit
- [ ] CAE outdated (Rev. 3)? ‚Üí AUTO-FAIL entire audit

**If ANY critical failure ‚Üí STOP HERE. Write report with FAIL status. Do NOT continue to Phase 3.**

---

### Phase 3: Government Source Link Verification (15% WEIGHT)

**Only proceed if Phase 2 = 100% correct (zero errors).**

**Objective:** Assess quality of government links in the calculator.

**Test 3.1: Link Quality Assessment**

For EACH government link in the calculator, score against 4 criteria:

1. **Primary Source?** (Links to DRE or official .gov.pt)
2. **Specific?** (Points to exact article/law, not homepage)
3. **Actionable?** (Users can DO something with it)
4. **Current?** (Not outdated years/versions)

**Scoring:**
- GOOD link: 4/4 criteria met
- BAD link: <4 criteria met

**Example GOOD link:**

## üéì EDUCATIONAL NOTES

### Why V2.0 Exists

**V1.0 Problem:**  
Auditors tested "how" the calculator works (functionality, UI, flow) but didn't verify "what" data it uses. Result: 93/100 score with 8 WRONG tax rates.

**V2.0 Solution:**  
1. **Data accuracy FIRST** (Phase 2 before anything else)
2. **Primary sources MANDATORY** (no secondary sources allowed)
3. **Zero tolerance** (even 0.1% off = critical fail)
4. **Auto-fail conditions** (wrong data = production blocker)

### Key Principle

> "A perfectly designed calculator with wrong data is worse than a rough calculator with correct data. Users trust financial tools with their livelihood."

### Data Accuracy > Everything Else

**Scenario:** Calculator has:
- ‚úÖ Beautiful UI (10/10)
- ‚úÖ Perfect UX flow (10/10)
- ‚úÖ Full transparency (10/10)
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation (10/10)
- ‚ùå Tax rate: 13% instead of 12.5% (FAIL)

**Result:** FAIL entire audit. Not 90/100. Not 40/40 minus points. **FAIL.**

**Why?** Because every calculation is wrong. The tool is misleading users.

---

## üîç COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Skip Phase 1 (primary source gathering)
- ‚ùå Test functionality before verifying data (Phase 2 FIRST)
- ‚ùå Accept secondary sources (blogs, generic PDFs)
- ‚ùå Round rates (12.5% ‚â† 13%, even if "close enough")
- ‚ùå Assume links work (test ALL government links)
- ‚ùå Give partial credit for wrong data (zero tolerance)
- ‚ùå Continue to Phase 3+ if Phase 2 fails

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Execute phases in order (1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí ...)
- ‚úÖ Verify EVERY constant line-by-line
- ‚úÖ Use only Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica as primary source
- ‚úÖ Test exact decimal values (0.125 not "around 12-13%")
- ‚úÖ Record version number from calculator footer
- ‚úÖ Stop immediately if critical failure found
- ‚úÖ Provide clear evidence for all findings

---
