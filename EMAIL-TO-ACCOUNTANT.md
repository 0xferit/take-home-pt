Hi [Accountant Name],

Thank you for the detailed analysis in the spreadsheet. I really appreciate the time you put into this.

To better understand the tax implications of different structures, I built a calculator that cross-checks calculations against the official 2025 tax legislation. When comparing my calculator's results with your spreadsheet, I found two potential discrepancies I'd like you to review:

### 1. Social Security (€751.14 difference)

- **Your formula:** €150,000 × 70% × 21.4% × 75% = €16,852.50
- **My concern:** This doesn't seem to apply the 12 × IAS monthly cap (€6,270) per Lei 110/2009, Art. 168º
- **My calculator:** €16,101.36 (using quarterly/monthly calculation with cap applied)

### 2. Solidarity Tax (€812.50 difference)

- **Your calculation:** €22,500 IRS only
- **My concern:** Solidarity tax on income >€80k per Lei 82-B/2014, Art. 191 may be missing
- **My calculator:** €23,312.50 (€22,500 base IRS + €812.50 solidarity on the €32,500 above threshold)

**Could you please review these points?** I want to ensure we're fully compliant, and I may be misunderstanding something.

### Calculator Access

I've made the calculator publicly available at: **https://take-home-pt.netlify.app/**

You're very welcome to use it to cross-check calculations. It includes:
- All 2025 tax brackets, IAS, RMMG values
- Social Security with cap calculations  
- NHR, IRS Jovem, and solidarity tax
- Detailed breakdown showing formulas
- Links to all official sources (Diário da República)

**I'd genuinely appreciate it if you could review the calculator and let me know if you spot any errors in my methodology.** I've done my best to implement everything correctly per Portuguese law, but a professional review would be invaluable.

Hi [Accountant Name],

Thanks for the spreadsheet analysis. I built a calculator to cross-check the numbers and found two potential discrepancies:

1. **Social Security:** Your €16,852.50 vs my €16,101.36 (12×IAS cap question)
2. **Solidarity Tax:** Your €22,500 vs my €23,312.50 (>€80k threshold)

Could you review? I may be misunderstanding something.

Please check it and let me know if you spot any errors in my methodology. Would really value your professional input.
