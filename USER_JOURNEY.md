## Executive Summary

### What Makes This Tool Valuable

TakeHome PT is **not a tax calculator**—it's a **business structure optimization planner** that answers one critical question:

> **"Which business structure puts the most money in my pocket?"**

### Proven Value (Based on User Journey Analysis)

The tool prevents costly structural mistakes:

- **Teresa (Software Developer, €85k)**: Discovers organized accounting gives her **€5,384 more** per year than simplified
- **Carlos (Consultant, €150k)**: Avoids switching to organized, staying simplified saves him **€4,657 per year**
- **Diana (Designer, €45k)**: Confirms simplified is optimal, avoiding **€3,669/year** in unnecessary accounting fees
- **Eduardo (Executive, €220k)**: Validates high-income calculations with solidarity tax, gains confidence in structure choice

### Core Innovation

Unlike tax calculators that show "how much you'll pay," this tool shows:
1. **Take-home income** across all three structures simultaneously
2. **Why one structure wins** (expense efficiency, admin costs, tax rates)
3. **When to transition** between structures (as income/expenses change)

### Assessment: 8.5/10 - Beta Launch Ready

**Strengths:**
- ✅ All mathematical accuracy issues resolved (solidarity tax, coefficients, costs)
- ✅ Three-structure comparison prevents tunnel vision
- ✅ First-year benefits comprehensive (IRS Jovem, SS exemption, 50% reduction)
- ✅ Intuitive user flow with real-time updates
- ✅ Activity code classification eliminates forced coefficients

**Pre-Launch Priorities:**
- 🔴 Export to PDF (all personas need this)
- 🔴 Mobile UX optimization (~40% of users)
- 🟡 Methodology/Assumptions tab (builds trust)
- 🟡 Calculation detail accuracy (eliminate confusion)

## Overview

### Application Purpose
TakeHome PT is a **business structure optimization planner** that helps self-employed professionals in Portugal maximize their net income. Rather than being a simple tax calculator, it's a comprehensive decision support tool that compares take-home income across three structures:

- **Freelancer (Simplified Regime)**: Using deemed expense coefficients (25% or 65% depending on activity)
- **Freelancer (Organized Accounting)**: Deducting real expenses with full accounting
- **Single-Member Company (LDA)**: Operating through a Portuguese limited liability company

**Key Value Proposition:**  
The tool doesn't just calculate taxes—it shows users **which structure puts the most money in their pocket** after accounting for:
- Income taxes (IRS) with progressive brackets or NHR flat rates
- Social Security contributions (21.4% on relevant income)
- Solidarity taxes (for higher incomes >€80k)
- Administrative/compliance costs (€800-€4,800/year)
- First-year benefits (IRS Jovem, SS exemption, 50% reduction)

### User Goals
1. **Primary Goal**: Identify which business structure maximizes annual take-home income
2. **Secondary Goals**:
   - Compare net income side-by-side across all three structure options
   - Understand why one structure wins (expense efficiency, admin costs, tax rates)
   - Model different scenarios (income growth, expense changes, benefit phases)
   - Plan optimal structure transitions (first-year benefits, IRS Jovem years 1-5)
   - Make informed decisions before consulting with accountants/lawyers
   - Validate eligibility for special tax regimes (NHR, IRS Jovem)

### What This Tool Is NOT
- ❌ **Not a tax filing tool** - It helps you choose a structure, not file taxes
- ❌ **Not legal/accounting advice** - Professional consultation still recommended
- ❌ **Not a compliance tool** - Doesn't handle invoicing, receipts, or documentation
- ✅ **It's a decision support and planning tool** for structure optimization

### Journey Stages
1. **Awareness**: User learns about structure optimization options
2. **Input & Configuration**: User enters their financial profile and preferences
3. **Comparison**: Tool shows take-home income across all three structures
4. **Analysis**: User explores why one structure wins and tests scenarios
5. **Decision**: User selects optimal business structure
6. **Action**: User consults with accountant/lawyer to implement chosen structure

4. **Calculation Details:**
   - Expands "How we calculated this" accordion
   - Sees step-by-step:
     ```
     Freelancer (Organized) Calculation:
     1. Gross income: €85,000.00
     2. Deduct real expenses: €85,000 - €6,000 = €79,000
     3. Relevant income for SS: €79,000 × 70% = €55,300
     4. SS annual: €55,300 × 21.4% = €11,834.20
     5. Taxable income: €79,000.00
     6. Apply IRS brackets: €18,394.15 (before exemptions)
     7. IRS Jovem exemption (100%): -€18,394.15
     8. Personal deductions: €4,462.15 (auto-applied)
     9. Final IRS: €0.00
     10. Total costs: €11,834 SS + €3,850 admin = €15,684
     11. Net income: €85,000 - €6,000 - €15,684 = €63,316
     ```

   - Thinks: "Wait, this says €63,316 but the card said €68,231?"
   - Re-reads more carefully, realizes calculation shown is simplified
   - Still somewhat confused but trusts the summary

5. **Decision Point:**
   - **Key Insight:** Organized accounting wins because:
     - Deducts real expenses BEFORE SS calculation (saves on SS)
     - IRS Jovem zeroes out all income tax anyway
     - Admin cost delta (€2,200) is smaller than SS savings (€894)
   
   - **Question:** "Should I also consider LDA for liability protection?"
   - Sees note: "LDA provides limited liability but adds €1,800/year in costs vs organized"

**Thoughts:**
- "IRS Jovem is INSANE! €0 income tax on €85k income!"
- "I should definitely go with organized accounting"
- "But wait, what about years 2-5 when IRS Jovem reduces?"
- "I wish I could see a multi-year projection"

   - Admin: €4,500
   - **Net: €88,761**

   - **Realizes:** Simplified wins because:
     - Deemed 25% (€37.5k) > Real expenses (€25k)
     - Lower taxable income = less IRS + less solidarity
     - SS is higher but offset by IRS savings

3. **Sensitivity Analysis (Mental):**
   - "At what expense level does organized become better?"
   - Plays with expenses:
     - If real expenses were €40k → Organized wins
     - If real expenses were €50k → Organized wins by more
   - **Insight:** Threshold is around €37.5k (the deemed 25%)

4. **Considers LDA:**
   - LDA is worst option at his income level
   - Extra admin costs (€4,800) + min manager SS not worth it
   - **Decision:** Stay as freelancer simplified

**Thoughts:**
- "I would have actually taken home LESS with organized accounting"
- "The 25% deemed expense coefficient gives me higher net income"
- "This planner just saved me from a costly mistake"

**Emotions:** 😌 Relieved, Informed, Grateful

**Pain Points:**
- 🟢 Tool prevented switching to lower take-home structure
- 🟡 Could use clearer explanation of breakeven points between structures

---

#### Stage 7: Documentation & Action (5 minutes)

**User Actions:**
1. Takes detailed screenshots of all three scenarios
2. Experiments with expense levels to find breakeven point:
   - Sets base expenses to €38,000 → Organized slightly wins

4. Books meeting with accountant to confirm
5. Plans to re-check annually as income grows

**Outcome:**
- ✅ Stays with structure that maximizes his take-home
- ✅ Understands why simplified beats organized in his case
- ✅ Avoids €4,657/year reduction in net income
- 📢 Shares tool with other consultants as setup planning resource

- Positioning Activity Type field FIRST
- Disabling NHR 20% options until eligible activity selected
- Showing clear help text indicating dependency

**Steps:**

1. **User sees activity type radio buttons (FIRST FIELD)**
   - Option A: "High-value professions (Article 151) - 75% taxable — NHR 20% eligible"
   - Option B: "General professional services - 35% taxable — NHR not applicable"
   - User feels uncertain
   - **Notices:** NHR dropdown below is disabled with message "Select activity type above"

2. **User clicks "What's my activity code?" button**
   - Modal/drawer opens
   - Shows searchable table of CAE codes

3. **User searches for their profession**
   - Types profession name (e.g., "software", "lawyer", "accountant")
   - Table filters in real-time
   - OR user types known CAE code (e.g., "62020")

4. **User finds matching code**
   - Sees code with description
   - Sees mapped activity profile
   - Example: "62020 - Computer consultancy → High-value (Article 151)"

5. **User returns to main form and selects activity type**
   - Selects appropriate radio button with confidence
   - Sees description below confirming coefficient
   - **INSTANTLY:** NHR dropdown below changes:
     - If high-value selected: Options enabled, green success message appears
     - If general selected: Options stay disabled, warning message appears

6. **User can now select NHR status (if eligible)**
   - NHR 20% options now enabled
   - Help text shows: "✅ High-value activity detected. NHR 20% flat rate is available"

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ User identifies correct activity profile
- ✅ User understands tax coefficient implications
- ✅ < 2 minutes to complete

**Error Scenarios:**
- ❌ User can't find profession in list
- ❌ Profession spans multiple codes
- ❌ User unsure between consulting vs services

**Improvements Needed:**
- 🎯 Add "Can't find your profession?" link to help/contact
- 🎯 Add common profession aliases (e.g., "programmer" → "computer programming")
- 🎯 Add "Between two options?" guidance

---

3. **User selects appropriate year**
   - Reads help text: "Available for residents under 35 with completed higher education"
   - Confirms eligibility
   - Selects year based on when they started working post-graduation

4. **Tool updates comparison in real-time**
   - Results tab shows exemption applied across all three structures
   - Breakdown explicitly states: "IRS Jovem exemption (75%): -€X,XXX"
   - User sees how benefit affects each structure option

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ User correctly identifies which year they're in
- ✅ Exemption correctly applied to IRS calculation
- ✅ User understands benefit value

**Error Scenarios:**
- ❌ User unsure if they qualify (age/education requirements)
- ❌ User unsure which year they're in (counting from graduation? first tax year?)
- ❌ User doesn't know if IRS Jovem can combine with NHR

**Improvements Needed:**
- 🎯 Add eligibility checker: "Do I qualify for IRS Jovem?"

## Decision Trees

### Decision Tree 1: Which Tax Structure Should I Choose?

**IMPORTANT:** NHR eligibility is determined by activity type, not chosen first. Select activity type → then NHR becomes available if eligible.

```
START: Self-employed professional in Portugal
│
├─ Q1: What is your activity type?
│  ├─ High-value (Article 151) → NHR 20% available
│  └─ General services → NHR not applicable, standard progressive only
│
├─ Q2: Do you have NHR status (original or 2.0)?
│  ├─ YES (and activity is eligible) → Q3
│  └─ NO → Q4
│
├─ Q2: What is your annual income?
│  ├─ < €60,000
│  │  ├─ Real expenses < deemed expenses (25% or 35%)?
│  │  │  ├─ YES → ✅ FREELANCER (SIMPLIFIED)
│  │  │  └─ NO → Consider: FREELANCER (ORGANIZED)
│  │  └─ Admin cost delta < expense deduction benefit?
│  │     ├─ YES → ✅ FREELANCER (ORGANIZED)
│  │     └─ NO → ✅ FREELANCER (SIMPLIFIED)
│  │
│  ├─ €60,000 - €150,000
│  │  ├─ Real expenses > deemed expenses?
│  │  │  ├─ YES → ✅ FREELANCER (ORGANIZED)
│  │  │  └─ NO → ✅ FREELANCER (SIMPLIFIED)
│  │  └─ Need limited liability for clients/contracts?
│  │     ├─ YES → Consider: LDA (tax-neutral, legal benefit)
│  │     └─ NO → ✅ FREELANCER (best tax outcome)
│  │
│  └─ > €150,000
│     ├─ Real expenses > €40k?
│     │  ├─ YES → ✅ FREELANCER (ORGANIZED) or LDA
│     │  └─ NO → ✅ FREELANCER (SIMPLIFIED)
│     └─ International clients requiring corporate entity?
│        ├─ YES → ✅ LDA (business requirement)
│        └─ NO → ✅ FREELANCER (best tax outcome)
│
└─ Q3: Are you under 35 with IRS Jovem eligibility?
   ├─ YES → IRS Jovem zeroes/reduces IRS significantly
   │  ├─ Decision based mainly on:
   │  │  ├─ Real vs deemed expenses
   │  │  └─ Admin cost tolerance
   │  └─ ✅ Likely: FREELANCER (SIMPLIFIED or ORGANIZED)
   │
   └─ NO → Q4
      │
      ├─ Q4: What is your income + expense situation?
      │  ├─ High income (>€100k) + high expenses (>€35k)
      │  │  └─ ✅ FREELANCER (ORGANIZED) or LDA

│  ├─ NO → ❌ Not eligible (must be resident)
│  └─ YES → Q3
│
├─ Q3: When did you complete your degree?
│  ├─ > 10 years ago → ❌ Benefit period expired
│  ├─ 1 year ago → Q4: What year of benefit?
│  │  └─ → Select: Year 1 (100% exemption)
│  ├─ 2 years ago → Select: Year 2 (75% exemption)
│  ├─ 3 years ago → Select: Year 3 (50% exemption)
│  ├─ 4 years ago → Select: Year 4 (50% exemption)

### Decision Tree 3: Simplified vs Organized Accounting for Freelancers

```
START: Freelancer choosing between simplified and organized
│
├─ Q1: What is your activity coefficient?
│  ├─ 75% (High-value Article 151)
│  │  └─ Deemed expenses = 25% of gross
│  └─ 35% (General services)
│     └─ Deemed expenses = 65% of gross
│
├─ Q2: What are your REAL annual deductible expenses?
│  ├─ Example: €20,000
│  └─ [User calculates using expense categories]
│
├─ Q3: Compare real vs deemed:
│  ├─ Real expenses > Deemed expenses?
│  │  └─ ✅ ORGANIZED LIKELY BETTER
│  └─ Real expenses < Deemed expenses?
│     └─ ✅ SIMPLIFIED LIKELY BETTER
│
├─ Q4: Factor in admin cost difference:
│  ├─ Organized admin: ~€2,400-€3,600/year (TOC fees)
│  ├─ Simplified admin: ~€360-€1,200/year (light support)
│  └─ Difference: ~€2,000-€2,500/year
│
├─ Q5: Calculate breakeven:
│  ├─ Expense deduction benefit > Admin cost delta?
│  │  └─ ✅ ORGANIZED WINS
│  └─ Expense deduction benefit < Admin cost delta?
│     └─ ✅ SIMPLIFIED WINS
│
└─ EXAMPLES:
   ├─ Income €80k, High-value (75%), Real expenses €15k:
   │  ├─ Deemed: 25% × €80k = €20k
   │  ├─ Real: €15k
   │  ├─ Deemed > Real by €5k
   │  └─ ✅ SIMPLIFIED WINS
   │
   ├─ Income €120k, High-value (75%), Real expenses €40k:
   │  ├─ Deemed: 25% × €120k = €30k
   │  ├─ Real: €40k
   │  ├─ Real > Deemed by €10k
   │  ├─ Tax/SS savings: ~€4,000
   │  ├─ Admin cost delta: ~€2,500
   │  ├─ Net benefit: ~€1,500/year
   │  └─ ✅ ORGANIZED WINS
   │
   └─ Income €60k, General services (35%), Real expenses €25k:
      ├─ Deemed: 65% × €60k = €39k
      ├─ Real: €25k
      ├─ Deemed > Real by €14k
      └─ ✅ SIMPLIFIED WINS (dramatically)
```

## Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

### Edge Case 1: Very High Income (>€300k)

**Scenario:** User enters annual income of €400,000

**Challenges:**
- Solidarity tax becomes major factor (5% on amounts >€250k)
- Social security cap (12× IAS) becomes less relevant
- LDA with dividend distribution might be optimal (not modeled)
- Tax optimization becomes more complex (holding structures, etc.)

**Current Behavior:**
- Tool handles basic math correctly
- But may not suggest optimal strategies at this level

**Recommendation:**
- Add disclaimer: "For income >€300k, consult a tax specialist for advanced strategies"
- Add note: "LDA with dividend distribution may offer additional benefits"

---

### Edge Case 2: Multiple Income Sources

**Scenario:** User has both Portuguese freelance income AND foreign passive income

**Challenges:**
- Tool assumes single income source
- NHR status affects different income types differently
- Solidarity tax applies to total taxable income (not just freelance)

**Current Behavior:**
- Tool only models Portuguese professional income
- Doesn't account for other income sources

**Recommendation:**
- Add input: "Other taxable income (if any)"
- Include in total for solidarity tax calculation
- Add help text: "Include rental income, foreign wages, etc."

---

### Edge Case 3: Part-Year Residency

**Scenario:** User moved to Portugal mid-year (e.g., started in July)

**Challenges:**
- First-year benefits may apply differently
- Pro-rata income calculations
- Unclear if IRS Jovem "Year 1" applies to calendar year or tax year

**Current Behavior:**
- Tool assumes full-year residency
- May overstate or understate benefits

**Recommendation:**
- Add question: "Full-year resident?" Yes/No
- If No: Add "Months of residency" input
- Pro-rate all annual calculations
- Add disclaimer about first-year benefit eligibility

---

### Edge Case 4: Mixed Activity Types

**Scenario:** User has both high-value (75%) and general services (35%) income

**Example:** Software consultant who also does photography side work

**Challenges:**
- Different coefficients apply to different income streams
- Most freelancers register single CAE code (primary activity)
- Tool can't split income by activity type

**Current Behavior:**
- Forces single activity profile selection
- May over-tax or under-tax depending on choice

**Recommendation:**
- Add option: "Mixed activity types"
- Allow income split: X% high-value, Y% general
- Apply weighted average coefficient
- Add help: "Use primary activity if <20% is secondary"

---

### Edge Case 5: IRS Jovem + NHR Combination Uncertainty

**Scenario:** User has both IRS Jovem and NHR 2.0/IFICI

**Question:** Do benefits stack? In what order are they applied?

**Tax Law Reality:**
1. NHR applies first: 20% flat rate on eligible income
2. IRS Jovem applies to final IRS amount: Reduces tax by exemption %

**Example:**
- Taxable income: €80,000
- NHR 20%: €16,000 IRS
- IRS Jovem Year 1 (100%): -€16,000
- Final IRS: €0

**Current Behavior:**
- Tool applies both correctly
- But user may not understand the interaction

**Recommendation:**
- Add explanation: "IRS Jovem applies to final IRS after NHR"
- Show calculation steps clearly
- Add example in help text

---

### Edge Case 6: Negative Taxable Income (High Deductions)

**Scenario:** User has very high deductible expenses (organized) that exceed income coefficient

**Example:**
- Gross: €50,000
- Real expenses: €45,000
- Net business income: €5,000
- Very low taxable income

**Challenges:**
- Social security still applies to net business income (not taxable)
- User may have cash flow issues if expenses are high
- Might trigger tax authority scrutiny

**Current Behavior:**
- Tool handles math correctly (low/zero IRS)
- But doesn't warn about scrutiny risk

**Recommendation:**
- Add warning: "High expense ratio may require detailed documentation"
- Add note: "Ensure all expenses are business-related and supported by invoices"

---

### Edge Case 7: LDA Manager Salary Ambiguity

**Scenario:** User checks "Apply minimum manager salary & SS" for LDA

**Confusion:**
- What exactly is "minimum manager salary"?
- How does it interact with freelance income drawing?
- Can user avoid this if they have foreign SS (exemption)?

**Current Behavior:**
- Checkbox exists but explanation is minimal
- User may mis-apply or not understand implications

**Recommendation:**
- Expand help text:
  ```
  LDA Manager Minimum Salary:
  - Portuguese LDA managers typically declare minimum salary (€522.50/month)
  - Annual total: €6,270 salary + €2,179 employer/employee SS
  - Check this if you will be LDA manager without foreign SS coverage
  - Uncheck if you have foreign social security exemption (e.g., via bilateral treaty)
  ```
- Add link: "Learn about SS exemptions for foreign residents"

---

### Edge Case 8: Input Validation Errors

**Scenario:** User enters invalid or extreme values

**Examples:**
- Negative income
- Expenses > income by large margin
- Very low income (€5,000/year) but high admin costs

**Current Behavior:**
- May calculate but produce nonsensical results
- No validation warnings

**Recommendation:**
- Add input validation:
  - Min income: €5,000 (below this, not viable business)
  - Max income: €1,000,000 (above this, suggest specialist)
  - Expenses should be < 95% of income (warn if exceeded)
  - Admin costs reasonable for income level (warn if >20% of income)
- Add error messages:
  - "Income seems low for self-employment. Are you sure?"
  - "Expenses exceed 90% of income. This may trigger audit risk."
  - "Admin costs seem high for your income level. Double-check amounts."

---

### Error Scenario 1: Browser Compatibility

**Issue:** User on old browser (e.g., IE11, old Safari)

**Current Behavior:**
- May not load, or display incorrectly
- JavaScript errors break functionality

**Recommendation:**
- Add browser detection
- Display warning: "This tool requires a modern browser. Please use Chrome, Firefox, Safari (latest), or Edge."
- Graceful degradation: Static fallback form

---

### Error Scenario 2: Calculation Timeout/Error

**Issue:** JavaScript error during calculation

**Current Behavior:**
- Results don't display, or show €0.00
- User confused, no error message

**Recommendation:**
- Add try-catch around calculation functions
- Display user-friendly error:
  ```
  ⚠️ Calculation Error
  We encountered an issue calculating your results. Please:
  - Check that all inputs are valid numbers
  - Try refreshing the page
  - If problem persists, contact support
  ```
- Log errors for debugging (privacy-respecting)

---

### Error Scenario 3: Network Issues (If Tool Becomes API-Based)

**Issue:** API call fails due to network timeout

**Current Behavior:**
- Client-side only (no API), so N/A currently
- But if future version uses backend...

**Recommendation (Future):**
- Add loading states: "Calculating..." with spinner
- Add retry logic (automatic 2-3 retries)
- Display error: "Unable to connect. Please check your internet and try again."
- Offline mode: Cache last calculation, allow offline viewing
