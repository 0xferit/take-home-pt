## Executive Summary

### What Makes This Tool Valuable

TakeHome PT is **not a tax calculator**‚Äîit's a **business structure optimization planner** that answers one critical question:

> **"Which business structure puts the most money in my pocket?"**

### Proven Value (Based on User Journey Analysis)

The tool prevents costly structural mistakes:

- **Teresa (Software Developer, ‚Ç¨85k)**: Discovers organized accounting gives her **‚Ç¨5,384 more** per year than simplified

- **Eduardo (Executive, ‚Ç¨220k)**: Validates high-income calculations with solidarity tax, gains confidence in structure choice

1. **Take-home income** across all three structures simultaneously
2. **Why one structure wins** (expense efficiency, admin costs, tax rates)
3. **When to transition** between structures (as income/expenses change)

### Assessment: 8.5/10 - Beta Launch Ready

## Overview

### Application Purpose
TakeHome PT is a **business structure optimization planner** that helps self-employed professionals in Portugal maximize their net income. Rather than being a simple tax calculator, it's a comprehensive decision support tool that compares take-home income across three structures:

- **Freelancer (Simplified Regime)**: Using deemed expense coefficients (25% or 65% depending on activity)
- **Freelancer (Organized Accounting)**: Deducting real expenses with full accounting
- **Single-Member Company (LDA)**: Operating through a Portuguese limited liability company

**Key Value Proposition:**  
The tool doesn't just calculate taxes‚Äîit shows users **which structure puts the most money in their pocket** after accounting for:
- Income taxes (IRS) with progressive brackets or NHR flat rates
- Social Security contributions (21.4% on relevant income)
- Solidarity taxes (for higher incomes >‚Ç¨80k)
- Administrative/compliance costs (‚Ç¨800-‚Ç¨4,800/year)
- First-year benefits (IRS Jovem, SS exemption, 50% reduction)

### User Goals
1. **Primary Goal**: Identify which business structure maximizes annual take-home income
2. **Secondary Goals**:
   - Compare net income side-by-side across all three structure options
   - Understand why one structure wins (expense efficiency, admin costs, tax rates)
   - Model different scenarios (income growth, expense changes, benefit phases)
   - Plan optimal structure transitions (first-year benefits, IRS Jovem years 1-5)
   - Make informed decisions before consulting with accountants/lawyers
   - Validate eligibility for special tax regimes (NHR, IRS Jovem)

### What This Tool Is NOT
- ‚ùå **Not a tax filing tool** - It helps you choose a structure, not file taxes
- ‚ùå **Not legal/accounting advice** - Professional consultation still recommended
- ‚ùå **Not a compliance tool** - Doesn't handle invoicing, receipts, or documentation
- ‚úÖ **It's a decision support and planning tool** for structure optimization

### Journey Stages
1. **Awareness**: User learns about structure optimization options
2. **Input & Configuration**: User enters their financial profile and preferences
3. **Comparison**: Tool shows take-home income across all three structures
4. **Analysis**: User explores why one structure wins and tests scenarios
5. **Decision**: User selects optimal business structure
6. **Action**: User consults with accountant/lawyer to implement chosen structure

   - Expands "How we calculated this" accordion
   - Sees step-by-step:
     ```
     Freelancer (Organized) Calculation:
     1. Gross income: ‚Ç¨85,000.00
     2. Deduct real expenses: ‚Ç¨85,000 - ‚Ç¨6,000 = ‚Ç¨79,000
     3. Relevant income for SS: ‚Ç¨79,000 √ó 70% = ‚Ç¨55,300
     4. SS annual: ‚Ç¨55,300 √ó 21.4% = ‚Ç¨11,834.20
     5. Taxable income: ‚Ç¨79,000.00
     6. Apply IRS brackets: ‚Ç¨18,394.15 (before exemptions)
     7. IRS Jovem exemption (100%): -‚Ç¨18,394.15
     8. Personal deductions: ‚Ç¨4,462.15 (auto-applied)
     9. Final IRS: ‚Ç¨0.00
     10. Total costs: ‚Ç¨11,834 SS + ‚Ç¨3,850 admin = ‚Ç¨15,684
     11. Net income: ‚Ç¨85,000 - ‚Ç¨6,000 - ‚Ç¨15,684 = ‚Ç¨63,316
     ```

   - Thinks: "Wait, this says ‚Ç¨63,316 but the card said ‚Ç¨68,231?"
   - Re-reads more carefully, realizes calculation shown is simplified
   - Still somewhat confused but trusts the summary

5. **Decision Point:**
   - **Key Insight:** Organized accounting wins because:
     - Deducts real expenses BEFORE SS calculation (saves on SS)
     - IRS Jovem zeroes out all income tax anyway
     - Admin cost delta (‚Ç¨2,200) is smaller than SS savings (‚Ç¨894)
   
   - **Question:** "Should I also consider LDA for liability protection?"
   - Sees note: "LDA provides limited liability but adds ‚Ç¨1,800/year in costs vs organized"

**Thoughts:**
- "IRS Jovem is INSANE! ‚Ç¨0 income tax on ‚Ç¨85k income!"
- "I should definitely go with organized accounting"
- "But wait, what about years 2-5 when IRS Jovem reduces?"
- "I wish I could see a multi-year projection"

**Emotions:** ü§© Excited, Empowered, Slightly Overwhelmed

   - NHR 20%: ‚Ç¨55,481 net

   - Difference: +‚Ç¨4,657/year vs organized
   - Difference: +‚Ç¨6,076/year vs LDA

2. **Examines Breakdown:**
   - **Why is simplified winning?**
   
   **Freelancer Simplified:**
   - Gross: ‚Ç¨150,000
   - Deemed expenses: 25% √ó ‚Ç¨150k = ‚Ç¨37,500 (automatic)
   - Taxable income: ‚Ç¨112,500
   - IRS progressive: ‚Ç¨38,047
   - Solidarity tax: ‚Ç¨812.50 (on ‚Ç¨80k-‚Ç¨112.5k tier)
   - Deductions: ‚Ç¨6,062 (personal + dependents)
   - Final IRS: ‚Ç¨32,797
   - Social Security: ‚Ç¨22,395
   - Admin: ‚Ç¨2,300
   - **Net: ‚Ç¨93,418**

   **Freelancer Organized:**
   - Gross: ‚Ç¨150,000
   - Real expenses: ‚Ç¨25,000 (deducted first)
   - Net business: ‚Ç¨125,000
   - Taxable: ‚Ç¨125,000
   - IRS progressive: ‚Ç¨43,347
   - Solidarity tax: ‚Ç¨1,125 (on ‚Ç¨80k-‚Ç¨125k tier)
   - Deductions: ‚Ç¨6,062
   - Final IRS: ‚Ç¨38,410
   - Social Security: ‚Ç¨18,725 (on ‚Ç¨125k, not ‚Ç¨150k)
   - Admin: ‚Ç¨4,500
   - **Net: ‚Ç¨88,761**

   - **Realizes:** Simplified wins because:
     - Deemed 25% (‚Ç¨37.5k) > Real expenses (‚Ç¨25k)
     - Lower taxable income = less IRS + less solidarity
     - SS is higher but offset by IRS savings

3. **Sensitivity Analysis (Mental):**
   - "At what expense level does organized become better?"
   - Plays with expenses:
     - If real expenses were ‚Ç¨40k ‚Üí Organized wins
     - If real expenses were ‚Ç¨50k ‚Üí Organized wins by more
   - **Insight:** Threshold is around ‚Ç¨37.5k (the deemed 25%)

4. **Considers LDA:**
   - LDA is worst option at his income level
   - Extra admin costs (‚Ç¨4,800) + min manager SS not worth it
   - **Decision:** Stay as freelancer simplified

**Thoughts:**
- "I would have actually taken home LESS with organized accounting"
- "The 25% deemed expense coefficient gives me higher net income"
- "This planner just saved me from a costly mistake"

## Detailed Interaction Flows

### Flow 1: Activity Code Discovery & Classification

**Trigger:** User unsure which activity profile applies to them

**CRITICAL FLOW:** Activity type MUST be selected before NHR status. The tool enforces this by:
- Positioning Activity Type field FIRST
- Disabling NHR 20% options until eligible activity selected
- Showing clear help text indicating dependency

**Steps:**

1. **User sees activity type radio buttons (FIRST FIELD)**
   - Option A: "High-value professions (Article 151) - 75% taxable ‚Äî NHR 20% eligible"
   - Option B: "General professional services - 35% taxable ‚Äî NHR not applicable"
   - User feels uncertain
   - **Notices:** NHR dropdown below is disabled with message "Select activity type above"

2. **User clicks "What's my activity code?" button**

   - Shows searchable table of CAE codes

3. **User searches for their profession**
   - Types profession name (e.g., "software", "lawyer", "accountant")
   - Table filters in real-time
   - OR user types known CAE code (e.g., "62020")

4. **User finds matching code**
   - Sees code with description
   - Sees mapped activity profile
   - Example: "62020 - Computer consultancy ‚Üí High-value (Article 151)"

5. **User returns to main form and selects activity type**
   - Selects appropriate radio button with confidence
   - Sees description below confirming coefficient
   - **INSTANTLY:** NHR dropdown below changes:
     - If high-value selected: Options enabled, green success message appears
     - If general selected: Options stay disabled, warning message appears

6. **User can now select NHR status (if eligible)**
   - NHR 20% options now enabled
   - Help text shows: "‚úÖ High-value activity detected. NHR 20% flat rate is available"

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ User identifies correct activity profile (CAE or manual)
- ‚úÖ User understands tax coefficient implications
- ‚úÖ User can verify codes on official sources
- ‚úÖ < 2 minutes to complete

**Error Scenarios:**
- ‚ùå User can't find profession in list

- ‚ùå User unsure between consulting vs services

**Verification Available:**
- ‚úÖ Official INE CAE Rev. 3 database linked
- ‚úÖ Portal das Finan√ßas CAE lookup tool linked
- ‚úÖ Portaria Article 151 list linked (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica)
- ‚úÖ User can always cross-check our classifications

     - Solidarity Tax:          ‚Ç¨X,XXX
     - Social Security:         ‚Ç¨XX,XXX
     = Total Taxes:             ‚Ç¨XX,XXX
     
     Admin Costs:               ‚Ç¨X,XXX
     Insurance:                 ‚Ç¨X,XXX
     
     = NET ANNUAL INCOME:       ‚Ç¨XXX,XXX
     ```

4. **User explores side-by-side comparison table**
   - Scrolls to table section
   - Sees all three structures in columns
   - Key metrics in rows:
     - Effective tax rate
     - Income tax
     - Social security
     - Total admin costs
     - Net income
   - Best value in each row highlighted with ‚úÖ

5. **User checks calculation methodology**
   - Expands "How we calculated this" section
   - Sees step-by-step for each structure:
     ```
     Freelancer (Simplified) Calculation:
     1. Gross income: ‚Ç¨XXX,XXX
     2. Apply 75% coefficient: ‚Ç¨XXX,XXX (taxable)
     3. Apply progressive tax brackets...
     4. Calculate social security on relevant income...
     ...
     ```

6. **User gains insight:**
   - Understands WHY one option wins
   - Identifies key drivers (deemed expenses, admin costs, SS calculation)
   - Feels confident to make decision

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ User understands relative rankings
- ‚úÖ User knows absolute savings (‚Ç¨X/year)
- ‚úÖ User can explain reasoning to accountant
- ‚è±Ô∏è < 5 minutes to full comprehension

**Error Scenarios:**
- ‚ùå User overwhelmed by numbers
- ‚ùå User doesn't understand why unexpected option wins
- ‚ùå User wants to explore "what if" scenarios

**Improvements Needed:**
- üéØ Add visual charts (bar/line graphs of net income)
- üéØ Add "Why this result?" explainer for counterintuitive outcomes
- üéØ Add scenario comparison feature (save multiple scenarios)

---

### Flow 5: Sensitivity Analysis & Scenario Testing

**Trigger:** User wants to test different assumptions

**Steps:**

1. **User completes initial calculation**
   - Sees results for current inputs

2. **User decides to test alternate scenario**
   - Example: "What if I had ‚Ç¨30k in expenses instead of ‚Ç¨15k?"

3. **User navigates back to Expenses tab**
   - Changes organized base expenses: ‚Ç¨15,000 ‚Üí ‚Ç¨30,000
   - Results auto-update (if live recalc enabled)
   - OR user clicks "Recalculate" button

4. **User returns to Results tab**
   - Sees updated comparison
   - Notes: "Organized now wins by ‚Ç¨4,000!"

5. **User tests multiple scenarios:**
   - Scenario 1: Low expenses (‚Ç¨10k)
   - Scenario 2: Medium expenses (‚Ç¨25k)
   - Scenario 3: High expenses (‚Ç¨40k)
   - Notes breakeven point

6. **User wishes to compare scenarios side-by-side**
   - ‚ùå Currently: Must take screenshots or write down results
   - ‚ú® Ideal: "Save scenario" button to compare multiple

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ User identifies breakeven thresholds
- ‚úÖ User understands sensitivity to key variables
- ‚úÖ User makes decision with confidence

**Pain Points:**
- üî¥ Can't save multiple scenarios for comparison
- üî¥ No "undo" if user wants to return to previous inputs
- üü° No guided sensitivity analysis ("What matters most?")

**Improvements Needed:**
- üéØ Add "Save scenario" feature with naming
- üéØ Add scenario comparison view (side-by-side grid)
- üéØ Add "Breakeven calculator": "At what expense level does organized beat simplified?"

## Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

### Edge Case 1: Very High Income (>‚Ç¨300k)

**Scenario:** User enters annual income of ‚Ç¨400,000

**Challenges:**
- Solidarity tax becomes major factor (5% on amounts >‚Ç¨250k)
- Social security cap (12√ó IAS) becomes less relevant
- LDA with dividend distribution might be optimal (not modeled)
- Tax optimization becomes more complex (holding structures, etc.)

**Current Behavior:**
- Tool handles basic math correctly
- But may not suggest optimal strategies at this level

**Recommendation:**
- Add disclaimer: "For income >‚Ç¨300k, consult a tax specialist for advanced strategies"
- Add note: "LDA with dividend distribution may offer additional benefits"

---

### Edge Case 2: Multiple Income Sources

**Scenario:** User has both Portuguese freelance income AND foreign passive income

**Challenges:**
- Tool assumes single income source
- NHR status affects different income types differently
- Solidarity tax applies to total taxable income (not just freelance)

**Current Behavior:**
- Tool only models Portuguese professional income
- Doesn't account for other income sources

**Recommendation:**
- Add input: "Other taxable income (if any)"
- Include in total for solidarity tax calculation
- Add help text: "Include rental income, foreign wages, etc."

---

### Edge Case 3: Part-Year Residency

**Scenario:** User moved to Portugal mid-year (e.g., started in July)

**Challenges:**
- First-year benefits may apply differently
- Pro-rata income calculations
- Unclear if IRS Jovem "Year 1" applies to calendar year or tax year

**Current Behavior:**
- Tool assumes full-year residency
- May overstate or understate benefits

**Recommendation:**
- Add question: "Full-year resident?" Yes/No
- If No: Add "Months of residency" input
- Pro-rate all annual calculations
- Add disclaimer about first-year benefit eligibility

---

### Edge Case 4: Mixed Activity Types

**Scenario:** User has both high-value (75%) and general services (35%) income

**Example:** Software consultant who also does photography side work

**Challenges:**
- Different coefficients apply to different income streams
- Most freelancers register single CAE code (primary activity)
- Tool can't split income by activity type

**Current Behavior:**
- Forces single activity profile selection
- May over-tax or under-tax depending on choice

**Recommendation:**
- Add option: "Mixed activity types"
- Allow income split: X% high-value, Y% general
- Apply weighted average coefficient
- Add help: "Use primary activity if <20% is secondary"

---

### Edge Case 5: IRS Jovem + NHR Combination Uncertainty

**Scenario:** User has both IRS Jovem and NHR 2.0/IFICI

**Question:** Do benefits stack? In what order are they applied?

**Tax Law Reality:**
1. NHR applies first: 20% flat rate on eligible income
2. IRS Jovem applies to final IRS amount: Reduces tax by exemption %

**Example:**
- Taxable income: ‚Ç¨80,000
- NHR 20%: ‚Ç¨16,000 IRS
- IRS Jovem Year 1 (100%): -‚Ç¨16,000
- Final IRS: ‚Ç¨0

**Current Behavior:**
- Tool applies both correctly
- But user may not understand the interaction

**Recommendation:**
- Add explanation: "IRS Jovem applies to final IRS after NHR"
- Show calculation steps clearly
- Add example in help text

---

### Edge Case 6: Negative Taxable Income (High Deductions)

**Scenario:** User has very high deductible expenses (organized) that exceed income coefficient

**Example:**
- Gross: ‚Ç¨50,000
- Real expenses: ‚Ç¨45,000
- Net business income: ‚Ç¨5,000
- Very low taxable income

**Challenges:**
- Social security still applies to net business income (not taxable)
- User may have cash flow issues if expenses are high
- Might trigger tax authority scrutiny

**Current Behavior:**
- Tool handles math correctly (low/zero IRS)
- But doesn't warn about scrutiny risk

**Recommendation:**
- Add warning: "High expense ratio may require detailed documentation"
- Add note: "Ensure all expenses are business-related and supported by invoices"

---

### Edge Case 7: LDA Manager Salary Ambiguity

**Scenario:** User checks "Apply minimum manager salary & SS" for LDA

**Confusion:**
- What exactly is "minimum manager salary"?
- How does it interact with freelance income drawing?
- Can user avoid this if they have foreign SS (exemption)?

**Current Behavior:**
- Checkbox exists but explanation is minimal
- User may mis-apply or not understand implications

**Recommendation:**
- Expand help text:
  ```
  LDA Manager Minimum Salary:
  - Portuguese LDA managers typically declare minimum salary (‚Ç¨522.50/month)
  - Annual total: ‚Ç¨6,270 salary + ‚Ç¨2,179 employer/employee SS
  - Check this if you will be LDA manager without foreign SS coverage
  - Uncheck if you have foreign social security exemption (e.g., via bilateral treaty)
  ```
- Add link: "Learn about SS exemptions for foreign residents"

---

### Edge Case 8: Input Validation Errors

**Scenario:** User enters invalid or extreme values

**Examples:**
- Negative income
- Expenses > income by large margin
- Very low income (‚Ç¨5,000/year) but high admin costs

**Current Behavior:**
- May calculate but produce nonsensical results
- No validation warnings

**Recommendation:**
- Add input validation:
  - Min income: ‚Ç¨5,000 (below this, not viable business)
  - Max income: ‚Ç¨1,000,000 (above this, suggest specialist)
  - Expenses should be < 95% of income (warn if exceeded)
  - Admin costs reasonable for income level (warn if >20% of income)
- Add error messages:
  - "Income seems low for self-employment. Are you sure?"
  - "Expenses exceed 90% of income. This may trigger audit risk."
  - "Admin costs seem high for your income level. Double-check amounts."

---

### Error Scenario 1: Browser Compatibility

**Issue:** User on old browser (e.g., IE11, old Safari)

**Current Behavior:**
- May not load, or display incorrectly
- JavaScript errors break functionality

**Recommendation:**
- Add browser detection
- Display warning: "This tool requires a modern browser. Please use Chrome, Firefox, Safari (latest), or Edge."
- Graceful degradation: Static fallback form

---

### Error Scenario 2: Calculation Timeout/Error

**Issue:** JavaScript error during calculation

**Current Behavior:**
- Results don't display, or show ‚Ç¨0.00
- User confused, no error message

**Recommendation:**
- Add try-catch around calculation functions
- Display user-friendly error:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Calculation Error
  We encountered an issue calculating your results. Please:
  - Check that all inputs are valid numbers
  - Try refreshing the page
  - If problem persists, contact support
  ```
- Log errors for debugging (privacy-respecting)

---

### Error Scenario 3: Network Issues (If Tool Becomes API-Based)

**Issue:** API call fails due to network timeout

**Current Behavior:**
- Client-side only (no API), so N/A currently
- But if future version uses backend...

**Recommendation (Future):**
- Add loading states: "Calculating..." with spinner
- Add retry logic (automatic 2-3 retries)
- Display error: "Unable to connect. Please check your internet and try again."
- Offline mode: Cache last calculation, allow offline viewing
