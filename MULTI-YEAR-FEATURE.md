# 10-Year Multi-Year Projection Feature

**Date Implemented:** 2025-10-17  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - Ready for Testing**

---

## Overview

Replaced single-year simulation with comprehensive **10-year projection** that shows:
- Year-by-year breakdown with income growth
- Cumulative net income tracking
- IRS Jovem declining schedule (100% → 25% over 10 years)
- First-year benefits in proper context
- NPV calculation with 3% discount rate
- Breakeven analysis

---

## What Changed

### Before (Single Year)
```
Annual View Only
- Shows one year snapshot
- IRS Jovem year selector unclear
- First-year benefits shown in isolation
- No long-term context
```

### After (10-Year Projection)
```
Comprehensive 10-Year Analysis
- Year-by-year table (10 rows)
- Income growth modeling (0-20% annually)
- IRS Jovem declining schedule visible
- First-year benefits shown in context
- Cumulative savings tracking
- Total 10-year comparison
```

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Logic Functions (`logic.js`)

**`computeMultiYearProjection(params)`**
- Computes 10-year projection for one structure
- Handles income growth year-over-year
- Applies IRS Jovem declining schedule
- First-year benefits only in year 1
- Returns year-by-year array + totals

**`compareStructuresMultiYear(params)`**
- Compares all 3 structures over 10 years
- Determines winner based on total net income
- Calculates breakeven year (if any)
- Returns complete comparison data

**Parameters:**
```javascript
{
  structure: 'simplified' | 'organized' | 'transparent',
  grossIncomeYear1: number,
  annualGrowthRate: number (0.00-0.20),
  years: number (default: 10),
  baseParams: { ... all other params }
}
```

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  yearByYear: [
    { year, income, netIncome, incomeTax, socialSecurity, 
      cumulativeNet, irsJovemReduction, effectiveRate }
  ],
  totals: {
    totalGrossIncome,
    totalNetIncome,
    totalIncomeTax,
    totalSocialSecurity,
    totalExpenses,
    totalIrsJovemSavings,
    averageEffectiveRate
  },
  npv: number,
  structure: string
}
```

### 2. New UI Input (`index.html`)

**Annual Income Growth Rate Field**
```html
<input type="number" id="income-growth-rate" 
       value="0" min="0" max="20" step="0.5">
<span class="input-group__suffix">% per year</span>
```

- Range: 0-20%
- Default: 0% (conservative)
- Help text: "Conservative: 0-3%, Moderate: 5%, Optimistic: 7-10%"

### 3. New Display Functions (`app.js`)

**`updateResultsDisplayMultiYear(freelancer, transparent)`**
- Shows 10-year summary totals
- Displays year-by-year breakdown table
- Color-codes differences (green=good, red=bad)
- Shows cumulative running totals

**`updateYearByYearTable(freelancer, transparent, name)`**
- Creates dynamic HTML table
- 10 rows (one per year)
- Columns: Year, Income, Freelancer Net, LDA Net, Difference, Cumulative
- Footer: 10-year totals
- Responsive design

**`updateComparisonTableMultiYear(freelancer, transparent)`**
- Updates comparison with 10-year totals
- Shows cumulative taxes and net income

**`updateRecommendationMultiYear(freelancer, transparent)`**
- Recommendation based on 10-year totals (not just year 1)
- Threshold: ±€5,000 difference over 10 years

**`updateWinnerBannerMultiYear(freelancer, transparent)`**
- Winner banner based on 10-year totals
- Shows total savings over decade
- Average take-home percentage

**`updateRecommendationDetailsMultiYear(freelancer, transparent)`**
- Detailed insights for 10 years
- Shows IRS Jovem total savings
- Includes income growth mention
- Cumulative tax differences

### 4. Updated Calculation Flow

**Old Flow:**
```
calculateAndUpdate()
  → computeSimplified() (single year)
  → computeTransparent() (single year)
  → updateResultsDisplayDual()
```

**New Flow:**
```
calculateAndUpdate()
  → compareStructuresMultiYear() (10 years)
    → computeMultiYearProjection() × 3 structures
      → computeSimplified() × 10 years
      → computeTransparent() × 10 years
  → updateResultsDisplayMultiYear()
  → updateYearByYearTable()
```

## Key Features

### 1. Income Growth Modeling
- User sets expected annual growth rate (0-20%)
- Applied year-over-year: `Year N = Year 1 × (1 + growth)^(N-1)`
- Conservative default: 0% growth
- Example: €60K with 5% growth → €97K in year 10

### 2. IRS Jovem Declining Schedule
- Year 1: 100% exemption
- Years 2-4: 75% exemption
- Years 5-7: 50% exemption
- Years 8-10: 25% exemption
- Automatically applied if enabled
- Total savings calculated and displayed

### 3. First-Year Benefits Context
- SS exemption only in year 1
- 50% IRS reduction only in year 1
- Shows impact on 10-year total
- No longer confusing single-year toggles

### 4. Cumulative Tracking
- Running total differences year-by-year
- See when structures break even
- Understand long-term impact

### 5. NPV Calculation
- 3% discount rate applied
- Present value of future earnings
- More accurate economic comparison

## Known Limitations

1. **Calculation Breakdown**
   - Currently shows placeholder for Year 1
   - Full 10-year breakdown would be too verbose
   - Future: Make expandable per year

2. **Assumptions**
   - Income growth is linear (not realistic but simple)
   - Doesn't account for inflation
   - Tax rates assumed constant (no 2026 updates)
   - Expenses grow with income (proportional)

3. **NPV Discount Rate**
   - Fixed at 3%
   - Not user-configurable (yet)
   - Standard for financial planning
