# Final Email to Accountant Rui

**To:** Rui (Accountant)  
**Subject:** Review Needed - Social Security Cap & Solidarity Tax  
**Date:** 2025-10-27

---

Hi Rui,

Thanks for the spreadsheet analysis. I built a calculator to cross-check the numbers and found two potential discrepancies:

**1. Social Security: Your ‚Ç¨16,852.50 vs my ‚Ç¨16,101.36 (difference: ‚Ç¨751.14)**

I see you used: ‚Ç¨150,000 √ó 70% √ó 21.4% √ó 75%

My concern is the 12 √ó IAS monthly cap (‚Ç¨6,270/month) per Lei 110/2009, Art. 168¬∫. When I calculate quarterly/monthly and apply the cap:
- Quarterly gross: ‚Ç¨150,000 / 4 = ‚Ç¨37,500
- Relevant income (70%): ‚Ç¨37,500 √ó 70% = ‚Ç¨26,250
- Monthly: ‚Ç¨26,250 / 3 = ‚Ç¨8,750
- Capped at: min(‚Ç¨8,750, ‚Ç¨6,270) = ‚Ç¨6,270
- Annual SS: ‚Ç¨6,270 √ó 21.4% √ó 12 = ‚Ç¨16,101.36

Also, should the 75% coefficient apply to SS? I thought it only applied to IRS taxation.

**2. Solidarity Tax: Your ‚Ç¨22,500 vs my ‚Ç¨23,312.50 (difference: ‚Ç¨812.50)**

Your calculation shows ‚Ç¨22,500 IRS (‚Ç¨112,500 √ó 20% NHR).

My understanding is that solidarity tax applies to taxable income >‚Ç¨80k per Lei 82-B/2014, Art. 191:
- Base IRS: ‚Ç¨112,500 √ó 20% = ‚Ç¨22,500
- Solidarity (Tier 1): (‚Ç¨112,500 - ‚Ç¨80,000) √ó 2.5% = ‚Ç¨812.50
- Total IRS: ‚Ç¨22,500 + ‚Ç¨812.50 = ‚Ç¨23,312.50

Could you review? I may be misunderstanding something.

## If You Want Even More Detail

If Rui needs more context, you can add this optional paragraph after the discrepancies:

> **Context:** I'm trying to decide between freelancer and transparent company structures, so I wanted to understand the exact numbers. The ‚Ç¨751 SS difference and ‚Ç¨812 solidarity tax difference add up to a material amount that affects my decision. I really appreciate your expertise here‚Äîjust want to make sure I'm planning correctly.

This explains:
- Why you care (decision-making)
- Why it matters (‚Ç¨1,563 total difference)
- Your appreciation for their help

But the current version is probably better‚Äîconcise and professional.

## Quick Reference: The Numbers

**Your Scenario (‚Ç¨150k NHR):**

| Item | Rui's Calculation | Your Calculator | Difference |
|------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Social Security** | ‚Ç¨16,852.50 | ‚Ç¨16,101.36 | **-‚Ç¨751.14** ‚úÖ |
| **IRS (incl. solidarity)** | ‚Ç¨22,500.00 | ‚Ç¨23,312.50 | **+‚Ç¨812.50** ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| **Net Impact** | | | **+‚Ç¨61.36** |

Net impact is minimal (‚Ç¨61.36 more you owe), but:
- SS overcalculation = you overpay
- Solidarity missing = you underpay (tax violation!)

So it's critical to correct both.
