### 🎯 Key Success Factors

**Why the Prompt Worked:**

1. **Clear Phase Order:**
   > "YOU MUST EXECUTE PHASES IN THIS EXACT ORDER: 1 → 2 → 3..."
   
   Agent understood this was non-negotiable.

2. **Explicit Tables:**
   ```markdown
   | Bracket | Income (€) | Official Rate | Calculator | Match? |
   |---------|-----------|---------------|------------|--------|
   | 1 | 0-8,059 | 12.5% | [VERIFY] | [Y/N] |
   ```
   
   Agent knew exactly what to fill in.

3. **Critical Failure Rules:**
   > "Even 0.1% difference = FAIL"
   
   Agent applied zero-tolerance correctly.

4. **Stop Conditions:**
   > "If Phase 2 fails → STOP immediately"
   
   Agent would have halted if errors found (not applicable here).

5. **Output Format:**
   ```markdown
   **Version Audited:** v[YYYY.MM.DD] ← MANDATORY
   ```
   
   Agent followed template exactly.
